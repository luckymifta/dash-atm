# ATM Script Imports Fix Complete

## Summary
The import issues in the `combined_atm_retrieval_script.py` file have been successfully fixed. The following changes were made:

1. Added the missing imports required for the script to run properly:
   - `import threading`: Required for `threading.Event()` on line 134
   - `from collections import deque`: Required for `deque(maxlen=50)` on line 142

2. Verified that no additional errors remain in the script after these changes.

## Verification
The script has been checked with the Pylance code analyzer, and no errors are reported. The script should now run without any import-related issues.

## Next Steps
The script should now be fully operational with:
- Correct environment variable loading from `.env` file
- Proper database connection using these environment variables
- All required imports for functionality
- Cash information retrieval and saving capability
- Continuous operation mode

To test the script, you can use:

```bash
# Basic run:
python backend/combined_atm_retrieval_script.py

# With cash info and database saving:
python backend/combined_atm_retrieval_script.py --save-to-db --fetch-cash-info

# Continuous operation mode:
python backend/combined_atm_retrieval_script.py --continuous --save-to-db --fetch-cash-info
```

All imports are now properly in place, and the script should execute without any Pylance warnings or runtime errors related to missing modules.
