# Timestamp Consistency Fix - Complete Implementation

## Issue Summary
The `retrieved_date` column in `terminal_details` was showing inconsistent timestamps compared to `created_at` and `updated_at` columns:
- `retrieved_date`: 2025-07-11 20:35:17.000 +0900
- `created_at`/`updated_at`: 2025-07-11 11:36:14.109 +0900

## Root Cause Analysis
The timestamp inconsistency was caused by **dual timestamp generation**:

1. **Data Processor Level**: `current_time = datetime.now(self.dili_tz)` was set when data processing began
2. **Database Level**: `current_dili_time = self._get_dili_timestamp()` was set when database operations began

There was a time delay between these two operations, causing `retrieved_date` (set by processor) to differ from `created_at`/`updated_at` (set by database defaults).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Timestamp Generation from Data Processors
- **File**: `backend/atm_data_processor.py`
  - Removed `current_time = datetime.now(self.dili_tz)` from `process_terminal_details()`
  - Removed `retrievedDate` field from terminal detail records
  - Updated `generate_failure_data()` to not set timestamps

- **File**: `backend/atm_cash_processor.py`
  - Removed timestamp generation from `process_cash_information()`
  - Removed `retrieval_timestamp` from cash records
  - Updated `_create_null_cash_record()` method signature
  - Fixed all method calls to match new signature

### 2. Centralized Timestamp Handling in Database
- **File**: `backend/atm_database.py`
  - Updated `save_terminal_details()` to always use `current_dili_time` for `retrieved_date`
  - Updated `save_cash_info()` to always use `current_dili_time` for `retrieval_timestamp`
  - Ensured all timestamps (retrieved_date, created_at, updated_at) use the same database timestamp

## Technical Changes Made

### Data Processor Changes
```python
# BEFORE: Inconsistent timestamp generation
current_time = datetime.now(self.dili_tz)
detail_record = {
    # ... other fields ...
    'retrievedDate': current_time,  # Different time from DB operations
}

# AFTER: Let database handle timestamps
detail_record = {
    # ... other fields ...
    # retrievedDate removed - database will set this consistently
}
```

### Database Changes
```python
# BEFORE: Try to use processor timestamp
retrieved_date = terminal.get('retrievedDate')
if isinstance(retrieved_date, str):
    # Complex conversion logic...
elif isinstance(retrieved_date, datetime):
    retrieved_date = self._convert_to_dili_tz(retrieved_date)
else:
    retrieved_date = current_dili_time

# AFTER: Always use database timestamp
retrieved_date = current_dili_time  # Consistent with created_at/updated_at
```

## Expected Results

After this fix, all timestamp columns should show **identical values**:
- `retrieved_date`: 2025-07-11 11:36:14.109 +0900
- `created_at`: 2025-07-11 11:36:14.109 +0900  
- `updated_at`: 2025-07-11 11:36:14.109 +0900

## Files Modified
1. `backend/atm_data_processor.py` - Removed timestamp generation
2. `backend/atm_cash_processor.py` - Removed timestamp generation
3. `backend/atm_database.py` - Centralized timestamp handling

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the main script: `python backend/combined_atm_retrieval_script.py`
2. Check database records for timestamp consistency
3. Verify all three timestamp columns show identical values

## Git Commit
- **Branch**: `feature/sigit-cash-information`
- **Commit**: `c591c9e` - "Fix timestamp consistency: synchronize retrieved_date with created_at/updated_at"
- **Status**: Pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps
- Re-run the main script to verify timestamp consistency
- Monitor logs to confirm all timestamps are now synchronized
- If issues persist, additional database-level constraints may be needed
