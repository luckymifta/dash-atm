# Password Reset Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete password reset flow for the ATM Dashboard, including backend API endpoints, email integration with Mailjet, and frontend React components.

## Frontend Components Implemented

### 1. Pages Created
- **`/auth/forgot-password`** - Forgot password page
- **`/auth/reset-password`** - Reset password page  

### 2. Components Created/Updated
- **`ForgotPasswordForm.tsx`** - Form for requesting password reset via email
- **`ResetPasswordForm.tsx`** - Form for resetting password with token
- **`LoginForm.tsx`** - Updated to include "Forgot Password?" link

### 3. API Service Updates
- Updated `authApi.ts` with new functions:
  - `forgotPassword(email)` - Request password reset
  - `verifyResetToken(token)` - Verify token validity
  - `resetPassword(token, newPassword)` - Reset password

## Backend Updates

### 1. API Endpoints
- **POST `/auth/forgot-password`** - Send password reset email
- **GET `/auth/verify-reset-token/{token}`** - Verify reset token
- **POST `/auth/reset-password`** - Reset password with token

### 2. Model Updates
- Updated `ForgotPasswordRequest` to only require email (removed username requirement)
- Updated API logic to find users by email only for better UX

### 3. Email Integration

- Secure token generation and storage

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Token Security
- 24-hour token expiration
- Single-use tokens (invalidated after use)
- User-specific tokens with email validation
- Secure random token generation

### 2. Security Best Practices
- Always return success message (don't reveal if user exists)
- Rate limiting considerations
- Audit logging for all password reset attempts
- IP address and user agent tracking

## User Flow

### 1. Request Password Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. System sends reset email if user exists
4. User receives professional email with reset link

### 2. Reset Password
1. User clicks reset link in email
2. Token is verified automatically
3. User enters new password with confirmation
4. Password is updated and user is redirected to login

### 3. Security Feedback

- Success confirmations
- Professional email template with branding
