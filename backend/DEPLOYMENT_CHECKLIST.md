## 🎯 Deployment Instructions for Windows Machine

### Step 1: Package Preparation ✅
Run the package creator to prepare deployment files:
```batch
create_deployment_package.bat
```

### Step 2: Transfer to Windows Machine
1. Copy the entire `ATM_Monitor_Windows_Deployment` folder
2. Place in `C:\ATM_Monitor\` (recommended)

### Step 3: Windows Installation
```batch
# Run as Administrator
cd C:\ATM_Monitor
install.bat
```

### Step 4: Configuration
1. Edit `.env` file with your settings:
```env
DB_HOST=88.222.214.26
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=dash
DB_USER=timlesdev
DB_PASS=timlesdev
LOGIN_URL=your_atm_system_url
```

### Step 5: Validation
```batch
test_installation.bat
run_single.bat --demo
```

### Step 6: Production Deployment
```batch
# For continuous operation
run_continuous.bat

# For Windows service (recommended)
install_service.bat  # Run as Administrator
```
