# Windows Database Connection Fix

## 🎯 ISSUE IDENTIFIED
The error you're seeing indicates that the database password is not being loaded from the `.env` file:

```
connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: fe_sendauth: no password supplied
```

## 🔧 QUICK FIX

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script
```cmd
cd backend
setup_windows.bat
```

This will:
- ✅ Check if `.env` file exists
- ✅ Create one from template if missing
- ✅ Install required Python packages
- ✅ Test database connection

### Step 2: Verify .env File
Make sure your `.env` file in the `backend/` directory contains:

```env
# Database connection details
DB_HOST=88.222.214.26
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=dash
DB_USER=timlesdev
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password_here
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace `your_actual_password_here` with your actual database password!

### Step 3: Test Database Connection
```cmd
cd backend
python test_db_connection_simple.py
```

This will verify that your database credentials work before running the main script.

### Step 4: Run the ATM Script
Once the database test passes:
```cmd
cd backend
run_continuous_with_cash.bat
```

## 🔍 WHAT WAS FIXED

1. **Environment Variable Compatibility**: Updated code to check both `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_PASS`
2. **Better Error Detection**: Added checks for missing `.env` file
3. **Debug Logging**: Added database config logging (without exposing password)
4. **Setup Automation**: Created `setup_windows.bat` for easy configuration
5. **Connection Testing**: Added `test_db_connection_simple.py` for verification

## 📋 TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] `.env` file exists in the `backend/` directory
- [ ] Database password is set in `.env` file (not empty)
- [ ] Database credentials are correct
- [ ] Database server is accessible from your Windows machine
- [ ] Required Python packages are installed (`psycopg2-binary`, `python-dotenv`)

## 🚀 READY TO PUSH

All fixes have been implemented and are ready to be pushed to GitHub for testing.
