# 🔧 Sidebar Navigation Fix for Fault History Report

**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Issue:** When clicking "Fault History Report" in the sidebar, the sidebar menu disappeared and users couldn't navigate to other pages.  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 **Problem Description**

- **Issue:** Fault History Report page was missing the sidebar navigation
- **Impact:** Users got "trapped" on the fault history page with no way to navigate back to other sections
- **Root Cause:** The `fault-history/page.tsx` was not using the `DashboardLayout` component

---

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added DashboardLayout Import**
```tsx
import DashboardLayout from '@/components/DashboardLayout';
```

### **2. Wrapped Component with DashboardLayout**
**Before:**
```tsx
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen bg-white">
    <div className="p-6 max-w-7xl mx-auto">
      {/* content */}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

**After:**
```tsx
return (
  <DashboardLayout>
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
      {/* content */}
    </div>
  </DashboardLayout>
);
```

### **3. Removed Redundant Styling**
- Removed `min-h-screen bg-white` (handled by DashboardLayout)
- Removed `p-6` padding (handled by DashboardLayout)
- Kept `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for content width constraint

---

## ✅ **Result**

The Fault History Report page now includes:
- ✅ **Sidebar Navigation:** Full sidebar with all menu options
- ✅ **Consistent Layout:** Matches other pages in the application
- ✅ **Navigation Freedom:** Users can now navigate between all sections
- ✅ **Protected Route:** Inherits authentication protection from DashboardLayout
- ✅ **Role-based Access:** Supports role-based permissions if needed

- ✅ `/dashboard` - Uses DashboardLayout ✓
- ✅ `/atm-information` - Uses DashboardLayout ✓
- ✅ `/user-management` - Uses DashboardLayout ✓
- ✅ `/logs` - Uses DashboardLayout ✓
- ✅ `/predictive-analytics` - Uses DashboardLayout ✓
- ✅ `/fault-history` - **NOW** Uses DashboardLayout ✓
